# Multi-class-classification-using-logistic-regression
use logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9). Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. We have given a data set in data.mat that contains 5000 training examples of handwritten digits.  The .mat format means that that the data has been saved in a native Octave/MATLAB matrix format, instead of a text (ASCII) format like a csv-file.
